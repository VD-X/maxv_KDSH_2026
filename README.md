Track A: Systems Reasoning with NLP and Generative AI
Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon 2026

This repository contains the complete implementation and documentation for our Track-A submission to the Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon 2026.

Overview
This project verifies whether character-specific statements are consistent or contradictory with long-form fictional narratives. The solution uses a retrieval-augmented Natural Language Inference (NLI) pipeline to ensure evidence-grounded reasoning over long documents.

Repository Structure

- `report/` – Final project report  
- `architecture/` – System architecture diagram  
- `submission/` – Final submission CSV file
